# chordfinder

A simple chord finder for 3-string Ukulele using C-G-A tuning as described by [here](https://github.com/eyaler/uku3le).

This is a very simple application that lists chords based on the root note and the chord. See the live page [here]().

The chords were generated using [Chordious](https://chordious.com/).
